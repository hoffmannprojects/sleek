On film sets and for video installations, a common problem is to find a way of playing back different video files on various screens and systems in sync with each other. Costly and bulky hardware solutions with video mixing boards are the usual approach.

Multi Display Network Player was developed for a German TV movie production in the need of an alternative:
A software solution for synchronous playback of various video files across multiple networked Mac & PC systems with multiple displays each.

One Mac/PC acts as the host. Any number of client systems can connect over the network. Each system in the network can load a video file for each of it's connected displays with an Explorer/Finder dialogue. Playback and stop can be invoked from any machine on the network.

## Details:
- Written in C#
- Engine: Unity
- Platform: PC/Mac
- Synchronous playback across Mac/PC systems over the network
- Support for multiple displays per system
