Explore the depths of the ocean in a little submarine, using a Wiimote motion controller! [Prototype, Master project] The prototype was created during a 5-days workshop about connected objects for players with mental disabilities at the French public video game school Cnam-Enjmin. A physical replica of the digital submarine (with a Wiimote controller hidden inside) was built to serve as a motion controller.

## Overview

- Engine: Unity
- Platform: PC
- Camera: third-person
- Character: a little, yellow submarine
- Controls: Wiimote (inside a physical replica of the yellow submarine), Keyboard

## Details

- Led a team of 12, providing resources and advice on designing for players with disabilities
- Led the design and implementation of a Wii Remote-based motion controller
- Conducted playtesting with players with mental disabilities
- Helped to implement the menu system with accessibility settings

We formed a sub-team to prototype, build, and implement the physical controller (here: experiments with an "Adruino" gyroscope)...

...and finally, by hosting a Wiimote controller, allowed wireless motion control of our in-game submarine.

...and the game rewards the player with satisfying visual feedback for collecting flock of fish. Challenge is only suggested by making the flocks impossible to miss.
