I am proud of having completed the [Complete C# Unity Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/){:target="_blank"} on udemy.com. Many more hours went into this, than indicated by the certificate. But it was totally worth it. I can highly recommend the course to anybody interested in C# and Unity development.
