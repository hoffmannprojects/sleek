![Laser Defender](/assets/img/portfolio/laserdefender01.jpg "Player shooting and destroying an enemy ship.")

A modern 2D clone of Space Invaders. The player can move his ship left and right to evade enemy projectiles, while shooting back himself. In a single infinite level, with enemies perpetually spawning, the goal is to reach the highest score before the player ship gets destroyed by enemy projectiles. Personal project.

## Details:
- Input controller for player ship.
- 2D animations in Unity's Mecanim animation framework.
- Triggers for animations.
- Enemies flying in a moving formation.
- New enemies spawn outside the play space and fly to their position in the formation.
- Particle systems for hits and exploding enemies.
- Sounds generated by events like shooting, destruction, hits.

- Written in C#
- Engine: Unity
- Platform: PC/Mac
